# Income and Education Level Analysis

Welcome to our group project on income and education level!

## Project Description

We will be analyzing a dataset on income and education level to explore the relationship between the two variables. Our goal is to understand the patterns in the data and to develop insights that will help policy makers in making decisions related to education and income distribution.

## Technologies Used

- R
- R Studio
- tidyverse package
- ggplot2 package
- dplyr package
- Markdown

## Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning:** We will start by cleaning the dataset and preparing it for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** We will use descriptive statistics and data visualization to explore the relationship between income and education level.
3. **Statistical Modeling:** We will fit regression models to the data to understand the relationship between income and education level while controlling for other relevant variables.
4. **Policy Implications:** We will summarize our findings and discuss the implications for policy makers.

## Project Deliverables

- A well-documented R Markdown report detailing our methodology, findings, and recommendations.
- A presentation summarizing our key findings and policy implications.

We hope our analysis will contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between income and education level, and ultimately inform policy decisions that promote a more equitable society.
